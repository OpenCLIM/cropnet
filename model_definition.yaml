  summary: >
    A crop model predicting potential wheat yield from climate data 
  description: >
    The CropNet_Wheat yield model simulates ‘potential’ yield of wheat growing under rainfed conditions in the UK, based on key meteorological inputs (solar radiation, temperature and precipitation). The model accounts for climatic variables, soil effects on water availability, and day length, but assumes no impact from non-climatic, agronomic parameters such as crop nutrition, pests or diseases.  The model does account the impacts of variation in sowing date, and the user can select whether to include the impacts of water limitation, direct heat stress and CO2 fertilisation.  The model runs at daily timesteps and outputs annual yield per hectare. The model has been designed and calibrated to produce efficient estimates of crop yield impacts over relatively large spatial extents and long timescales (i.e. climate change impacts on patterns of yield across the UK).

      - name: RCP
        title: RCP Scenario
        description: Which Scenario to use for CO2 fertilisation, corresponding to the scenario used in the UKCP18 model runs. Only one scenario was used for RCP2.6. 4 are available for RCP8.5, corresponding to the ensemble members that were downscaled to 1km from 12km spatial resolution. Note that this only changes the CO2 concentrations in the model, it does not change the driving data. Data is available for 4 ensemble members for both RCP2.6 and 8.5. It is recommended that the scenario selected matches the driving data used, e.g. RCP Scenario '8.5_06' should be used when the driving data is ensemble member 06 RCP8.5. To turn off CO2 fertilisation choose the 'off' option.

  summary: >
    A crop model predicting potential wheat yield from climate data 
  description: >
    Created by John Redhead and Matt Brown at UKCEH as part of the CropNET and OpenCLIM projects. 
    Potential yield is the maximum possible yield acheivable given the climate conditions and in 
    the absence of any other limiting factors such as pests. Water limitation, heat stress and 
    CO2 fertilisation (optional) are included. The resolution of the model is the resolution of
    the driving data provided. Water stress and saturation are determined using an 'available 
    water capacity' derived from the SHETRAN hydrological model. Mode will run for one calendar
    year from starting data specified. See Lynch et al. 2017 for more details on the model.
